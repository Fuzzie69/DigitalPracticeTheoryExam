## How To Create A Multipart Question

Multipart questions are authored as normal items in `questions.json` with extra metadata so their parts stay together and in order while the exam shuffles blocks.

Notes
- Exams include 1–3 multipart groups when available; parts stay contiguous and ordered, but groups are interleaved among singles.
- For unit-required numeric answers, missing units will be flagged with a note in results.
